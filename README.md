# App description:
 * Purpose:

    The purpose of this rails app is to creata a two-side market place for Magic players and people who are interested in playing magic to have a place to trade their cards. 
    
    Every user can buy cards from the market as long as they are registered. Users can also register themselves as a seller so that they can trade their stocks with other users.

    There are other online trading websites such as eBay and Amazon as well that allows users to trade their cards. But as an app designed by magic players, one of the features of this app is to help a user to find a magic card that he/she wants. 
    
    By inserting multiple searching conditions, users can narrow down to an explict result about the cards they are looking for and also if they are stocked or not. So instead of users switching between the magic card database and trading websites, we offer users the opportunity to do two things in one step with less fraustration.
